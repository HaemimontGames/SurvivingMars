# Documentation for *UpgradableBuilding*

## Overview

Property holder class. Contains properties required to define all three building upgrades.<br>
<br>
Each building can have up to three upgrades, this division is internally called tiering. I.e. the first upgrade of a building is tier one, second is tier two, etc. This has no special meaning and is mostly used for upgrade identification purposes.<br>
<br>
All upgrade properties are formed in the following fassion (.. is the lua concatenation operator): "upgrade" .. tier .. "_" .. upgrade_property_base_name. So, if one needs to access the "id" property of a tier two upgrade, the actual member to access would be "upgrade2_id".<br>
