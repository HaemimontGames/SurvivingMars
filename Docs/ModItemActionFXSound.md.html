ActionFXSound
==================
This mod item creates and plays sound effects when an FX action is triggered. Inherits [ActionFX](ActionFX.md.html).

Properties
------------------
Cooldown
: Cooldown (in ms) before the same sound FX can be triggered again.

Sound
: The id of the sound preset, which will be used to play a sound.

FadeIn
: Fade in time in milliseconds.

FadeOut
: Fade out time in milliseconds.

Source
: Sound listener object or position. Allowed values are "UI", "Actor", "Target", "ActionPos", "Camera".

Spot
: The name of the spot, to which the sound should be attached.

SpotsPercent
: Percent of random spots that should be used. One random spot is used when the value is negative.

Offset
: Offset from the target spot.

OffsetDir
: Offset direction. Allowed values are "", "SourceAxisX", "SourceAxisX2D", "SourceAxisY", "SourceAxisZ", "ActionDir", "ActionDir2D", "FaceTarget", "FaceTarget2D", "FaceActor", "FaceActor2D", "FaceActionPos", "FaceActionPos2D", "Random2D", "SpotX", "SpotY", "SpotZ", "RotateByPresetAngle"

AttachToObj
: If the sound is attached to the object, it will be played whenever the camera gets close to the object, even if it was away during the creation of the object. There can be only one attached sound to an object at a time. Attaching a new one removes the active one, so this is best saved for a single sound that plays permanently.
