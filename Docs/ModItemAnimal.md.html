This mod item allows you to define a new animal.
There are several different groups of animals:

1. Household pets - Animals that roam the dome, go to gardens and residence buildings and play animations there. Household pets' entity should have the following states - "idle", "jump", "pee", "run", "sleep", "walk". Examples - cat, dog.

2. Roaming pets - Animals that roam the dome and go to gardens. Entity states - "idle", "run"(optional), "walk", "graze". Examples - deer, goat, llama, penguin, pony, rabbit

3. Static pets - Animals that only roam gardens. States - "idle", "walk". Examples - platypus, tortoise.
	
4.  Pasture animals  - Animals that live in ranches. States - "idle", "walk", "graze". Note that these animals scale from 85% up to 115% of entity's original size during their lifetime. Examples:<br/>
  Ranch(InsidePasture) - cow, goat, pig, ostrich<br/>
  Outside Ranch(OpenPasture) - chicken, rabbit, goose, turkey

Please consider the places the animal visits when choosing size for the entity.

Description
: Short, user-visible description of that animal and its effects.

Entities
: The game will pick one of the entities randomly, when spawning this animal.

Ambient life suffix (Household pets and roaming pets only)
: Animals have some predefined programs that they follow when they go into a garden. These programs are called "Ambient life programs". Different animals go to different spots and play different animations in the garden, depending on the program that they use. Which program they use is determined by this suffix. For example cats and dogs use the "Pet" suffix and the program with this suffix walks the animal in the garden, plays "jump", "pee" and "sleep" on some spots of the garden. If animal's entity does not have the animation the program tries to play, it will just stay idle.
