Colony Color Scheme
===================

This mod item type allows you to create new Colony Color Schemes (named Building Colors in-game) that can be applied to buildings though the Command Center.
These schemes define how specific parts, which we call ?, of in-game objects will be rendered. These parts are separated into 6 categories:
Outside, Inside, Mining, Electro, Life, Vehicles. What will actually be affected is the roughtness, metalic and base colors of these parts.
New color schemes will automatically appear in the Building Colors category of the Command Center.
To define which material will be used where, buildings will have four "Palette color #" properties with a dropdown list of all materials available to a Colony Color Schemes.


Colorization Textures
=====================

A colorization texture should be added to all Blender models that can take advantage of the Colony Color Schemes.
This texture must be named "Colorization" and must use "UVChannel_1".
Also, an appropriate number should be set for the "Number of masked colors in CM" property, depending on the number of parts the model is separated into. This property can be found inside the Haemimont Material. The maximum number of parts is 4.
The texture will act as four masks combined into one:
- Black color (#000000ff) will be ignored.
- Red color (#ff0000ff) will mark the "first" part.
- Green color (#00ff00ff) will mark the "second" part.
- Blue color (#0000ffff) will mark the "third" part.
- The alpha channgel (#00000000) will mark the "fourth" part.
There cannot be any mixing at the edges between two different parts and all colors must match those hex codes exactly.
The Base Color texture should also be prepared. Parts that will be colorized should be grayscale. Recomended values range from 190 to 220.
You can always use the sample Subsurface Heater asset, that is supplied with the game, as reference.
