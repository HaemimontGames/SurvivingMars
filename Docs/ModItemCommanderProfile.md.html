Commander Profile
=================

This mod item allows you to define a commander profile. It can be selected in the new game menu and has a significant effect over gameplay. Each commander profile has some specific properties and game effects. [Here](LuaFunctionDoc_Gameplay.md.html) can be found some useful functions for creating effects.

Gameplay effects for the Commander Profile can be defined using [Effects](ModItemEffect.md.html). They can influence global consts in different ways, unlock various gameplay items at game start and impact player structures at different stages of creation. Game effects are the most conveninent way to implement functionality for your Commander Profile. 

Commander Profiles can be tested easily in the **Mod Editor** if it is the ["currently edited"](index.md.html#welcometomoddingsurvivingmars!/modeditor) mod.
To do this, you need to:
 - Enable your mod in the **Mod Manager**.
 - Have an unpacked version of your mod in your *`%AppData%/Surviving Mars/Mods`* folder.
 - Have it be the most recently saved mod.
 - Have only one Commander Profile mod item.
