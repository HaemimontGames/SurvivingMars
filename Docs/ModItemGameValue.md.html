Game Value
==========

The gameplay simulation in *Surviving Mars* involves hundreds of numeric constants. They are initialized to their default values when the mission starts, and are usually modified by technologies researched by the player. This mod item allows you to modify them for the entire duration of the mission.

Each modification can apply one percentage-based and one amount-based change; the exact formula looks like this:

~~~~~
ModifiedValue = BaseValue * (100 + percent) / 100 + amount
~~~~~

For example, to double a value, you'd use:

~~~~~
amount = 0
percent = 100
ModifiedValue = BaseValue * (100 + 100) / 100 + 0 = BaseValue * 2
~~~~~

To halve a value, you'd use

~~~~~
amount = 0
percent = -50
ModifiedValue = BaseValue * (100 - 50) / 100 + 0 = BaseValue * 0.5
~~~~~

If several modifiers are applied to the same value, their amounts are summed together, their percentages are summed together, and the results are applied in the usual way:

~~~~
ModifiedValue = BaseValue * (100 + percent1 + percent2 + ...) / 100 + amount1 + amount2 + ...
~~~~
