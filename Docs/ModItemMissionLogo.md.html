Mission Logo
============

This mod item type allows you to create new colony logos, that can be chosen from the "New Game" menu.

Colony logos should be PNG images (with transparency, if you want them to be round like the ones included with the game).
They need to be square, power-of-two sized - recommended sizes are 512x512 and 1024x1024.
You can find a Photoshop PSD file in the mod sample assets folder installed with the game with the various layers the game logos used, if you want to use them as a starting point.

To create a functioning Mission Logo item, you need to first create a Decal mod item.

Decal
=====

Add a new Decal mod item from the New Item menu. Fill out the Name, Entity Name and Display Name properties with something descriptive, but make the Entity Name an identifier (no spaces, no punctuation, just Latin letters, digits and underscore); to avoid clashes with other mission logos in your mod or other mods, include the name of your mod, e.g. FooMod_Decal_Logo1. None of these names will be user-visible, but keep them meaningful to yourself.

Click on the "..." in the Image line and select the image file you have prepared - it can be anywhere on your disk. Click on "Import" next to it.


Mission Logo
============

Now select "New MissionLogo" from the New Item Menu.
From the "Decal Mod Entity" drop-down menu, choose the Decal you just created.
Enter a Display name - this is how users will see your logo listed in the "New Game" screens.

Click on the "..." next to the "UI File" line, navigate to your mod folder (you can click the second button in the Mod Editor window toolbar to find it) and choose an appropriate image to be displayed in the first "New Game" screen. Usually logos in that screen look different from the decals on buildings - see the provided sample asset on Mission Logos.

Click "Save" and return to the main menu to test the logo in the "New Game" screens.
