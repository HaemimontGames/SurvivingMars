Mission Sponsor
===============

This mod item allows you to define a mission sponsor. It can be selected in the new game menu and has a significant effect over gameplay. [Here](LuaFunctionDoc_Gameplay.md.html) can be found some useful functions for creating effects.

Gameplay effects for the Mission Sponsor can be defined using [Effects](ModItemEffect.md.html). They can influence global consts in different ways, unlock various gameplay items at game start and impact player structures at different stages of creation. Game effects are the most conveninent way to implement functionality for your Mission Sponsor. 

Misson Sponsors can be tested easily in the **Mod Editor** if it is the ["currently edited"](index.md.html#welcometomoddingsurvivingmars!/modeditor) mod.
To do this, you need to:
 - Enable your mod in the **Mod Manager**.
 - Have an unpacked version of your mod in your *`%AppData%/Surviving Mars/Mods`* folder.
 - Have it be the most recently saved mod.
 - Have only one Mission Sponsor mod item.
