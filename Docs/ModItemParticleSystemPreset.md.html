Particle System
==================
Defines new particle systems, which can be placed using [ActionFXParticles](ModItemActionFXParticles.md.html).
Particle systems consist of a list of particle behaviors. These behaviors define what particles are spawned, how they act and what their lifetimes are.

Properties
------------------
Simul FPS(self.simul_fps)
: The simulation framerate.

Speed-up(self.speed_up)
: How many times the particle simulation is being sped up.

Presim time (sec)(self.presim_time)
: How many seconds to presimulate, before showing the system for the first time.

Max starting phase time (sec)(self.rand_start_time)
: Maximum additional presim time used to randomize the starting phase of the particle system.

Camera distance offset(self.distance_bias)
: How much to offset the particle system relative to the camera. It is used to make the particle system to appear always on top of some other transparent object.

Particles scale with object(self.particles_scale_with_object)
: Particle size scales with the object scale

Game time animated(self.game_time_animated)
: Will animate in game time, i.e. will pause when the game is paused or slowed down.
Vanish when killed(self.vanish)
: Fx will disappear completely when destroyed, without waiting the existing particles to reach their age.

Particle Texture
==================
This mod item lets you import images, which can be used as textures for particle systems.
The image files can be PNG or TGA images. They need to be square, power-of-two sized.

Click on the "..." button in the Image line and select the image file you have prepared - it can be anywhere on your disk. Click on **"Import"** next to it.
Note that this image needs to be square and its dimensions have to be a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...).
Importing will convert the image to a format usable by the game and will also create a fallback texture for it.
Keeping the original image file and the Particle Texture mod item in the completed mod when publishing it is not necessary.
