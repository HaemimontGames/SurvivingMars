Radio Station
=============

Radio Station mods allow you to add new radio stations to the game - bundles of audio tracks that are played in random order. The user can select which radio stations to play via the button in the in-game interface.

Audio tracks must be stereo files compressed with the [Opus codec](http://opus-codec.org/) and must be placed in a subfolder of the mod folder.

Properties
----------

Name
: This is the internal name of the radio station, by which the Lua code will see identify it. Use something unique that won't clash with other mods' radio stations.

Comment
: Not used by the game - feel free to add anything for your reference.

Display Name
: This is the user-visible name of the radio station, as will appear in the game's Radio Station menu.

Folder
: This is the name of the folder containing the audio tracks, relative to the mod folder.

Silence between tracks
: This is the pause made between tracks by the default play logic.

function Play(self)
: This function performs the track selection and playback of the tracks in the radio station - leave blank for the default behaviour that plays the tracks randomly. It is started in its own [Lua thread](LuaThreads.md.html) and should run an infinite loop, choosing and playing tracks forever. It will be killed externally when the user selects another radio station.

:The default play function distinguishes between three types of files - Blurb, Talks and Commercials. Everything else found in the tracks folder is percieved as a song. For a track to be perceived as a commercial, the name has to contain "_ Commercials_ ". Simularly, for Blurb and Talks the name has to include "_ Blurb_ " or "_ Talks_ " respectively, as well as indeces in the form of "_ [index1]_ [index2]". For example, a file containing a talk might be named like that - "NewWaveRadio_Talk_8_2.opus". The order of playing the tracks is generelly speaking as follows: a small random number of songs, followed by a blurb and a commercial, then again a small number of songs, followed by a talk. 


Here's an example play function that lists all files in the tracks folder, shuffles them randomly and plays them one by one:

~~~~~~~~~ Lua
local err, files = AsyncListFiles(self:GetTracksFolder(), "*.opus") -- find all files in the folder with opus extension
if err or not next(files) then return end	-- skip if enumeration fails or folder is empty
for i = 1, #files do
	files[i] = string.sub(files[i], 1, -6) -- strip the opus extension
end
while true do
	table.permute(files, AsyncRand())           -- shuffle files list, with random seed
	for _, file in ipairs(files) do
		Music:PlayTrack({ path = file })        -- start playing one track via the music subsystem
		WaitMsg("MusicTrackEnded", 30*60*1000)  -- wait till it ends, or at most 30 minutes
		Sleep(self.silence * 1000)              -- pause for silence
	end
end
~~~~~~~~~


Here's another example play function, which finds files containing "music" and "dj" in the tracks folder, shuffles them and plays them alternatingly

~~~~~~~~~ Lua
local err, files = AsyncListFiles(self:GetTracksFolder(), "*.opus") -- find all files in the folder with opus extension
if err or not next(files) then return end	-- skip if enumeration fails or folder is empty
local dj = {}
local music = {}
for i = 1, #files do
	files[i] = string.sub(files[i], 1, -6) -- strip the opus extension
	if files[i]:find("music",1,true) then	-- check if the file name contains "music"
		music[#music+1] = files[i]	-- if so, add it to the music files list
	elseif files[i]:find("dj",1,true)then	--check if the file name contains "dj"
		dj[#dj +1] = files[i]	-- if so, add it to the DJ announcement files list
	end
end
local music_index = #music +1
local dj_index = #dj +1
while true do
	if(music_index >#music) then	-- if at the end of the music list, shuffle and start from the beginning
		table.permute(music)
		music_index =1
	end
	if(dj_index> #dj) then	-- if at the end of the DJ anouncment list, shuffle and start from the beginning
		table.permute(dj)
		dj_index = 1
	end
	Music:PlayTrack({ path = dj[dj_index] }) -- play a DJ announcement
	WaitMsg("MusicTrackEnded", 30*60*1000)  -- wait till it ends, or at most 30 minutes
	Music:PlayTrack({ path = music[music_index] }) -- play a music piece
	WaitMsg("MusicTrackEnded", 30*60*1000)  -- wait till it ends, or at most 30 minutes
	Sleep(self.silence * 1000) -- pause for silence
	-- increment the indices so you can access the next file in the list
	dj_index = dj_index+1 
	music_index = music_index+1
end
