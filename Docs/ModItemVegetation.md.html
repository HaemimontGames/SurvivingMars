==========

This mod item allows you to define new vegetation.
Note that due to technical reasons the maximum count of defined vegetation presets is 15.

Properties
----------
Group
: Indicates the group of the vegetation. If you want your vegetation to be available in open farm, choose the "Vegetable" group. Vegetation in other groups is available in Forestation plant.

Id
: Internal game id for that vegetation, used in various functions that work over it. This should be unique in terms of vegetation ids.

Display Name
: This is the user-visible name of the vegetation.

Description
: Short, user-visible description of that vegetation and its effects.

Display Icon
: File path to vegetation image used in infopanels.

Locked
: Indicates if the vegetation is initially locked.

Grid Id
: Internal id number used to identify the vegetation in a vegetation grid. Make sure the number is from 11 to 15, because ids from 1 to 10 are taken by existing vegetation presets. Every vegetation should have different Grid Ids.

Is Selectable
: This functionality is not supported. Leave this property as it is.

Tint Group
: Color modifier group, which chooses randomly different color modifier for the vegetation from already defined RGB color tables - trees, grass.

Output Resource
: The resource that the vegetation grants when harvested.

Output Amount
: The resource amount that the vegetation grants when harvested.

Add Local Soil Quality On Grown
: The total amount of soil quality the vegetation adds to the tile it is placed on while growing.

Add Neighbor Soil Quality On Grown
: The total amount of soil quality the vegetation adds to the neighbour tiles of the tile it is placed on while growing.

Soil Quality Fall Off Range
: Neighbour soil quality will be applied to hexes in range this number + 1 from the center with value degradation.

Classes
: A set of classes, from which the entity/entities for a single unit of the vegetation will be picked when placing it.

Single centered entity
: Indicates whether the vegetation visualisation will be a single entity centered in the tile. 

Textures
: Textures that will be applied in vegetation's tile.

Growth Time
: The time it takes for the vegetation to grow.

Growth Type
: There are three different growth types, which indicate the way the vegetation visually grows. Popup - the entity emerges out of the ground. Scaleup - vegetation changes its size scaling the entity up. States - in this case the entity has to have 4 states - "idle1", "idle2, "idle3", "idle4" and the vegetation grows by going through these states - from "idle1" to "idle4".

Count Per Hex
: The count of entities placed per single vegetation unit.

Random Count Add
: Adds a random number from 0 to this number to Count Per Hex when placing vegetation.

Hex Margin
: Margin from hex border where plants will spawn.

Min Scale
: Min scale for each placed entity.

Max scale
: Max scele for each placed entity.

Placement Consumption
: The amount of seeds that buildings, which place the vegetation, consume when placing.

Terrains Underneath
: Terrain types applied under this vegetatation.

Classes (Beautifications)
: Additional entities for the vegetation.

Min Scale (Beautifications)
: Min scale for beautification entities.

Max scale (Beautifications)
: Max scale for beautification entities.

Remains on wither
: Indicates whtether vegetation remains visually upon withering.

Min Soil Quality
: The minimal amount of soil quality for the vegetation to grow. if the soil quality is lower than this number in vegetation position, it will wither.

Min Heat:
: Heat is internally used number, which represents temperature in given position.

Min Terraforming Param 1
: Choose terraforming parameter which will restrict buildings from planting this vegetation.

Min Terraforming Amount 1
: Choose min amount for the terraforming parameter restriction.

Min Terraforming Param 2
: Choose terraforming parameter which will restrict buildings from planting this vegetation.

Min Terraforming Amount 2
: Choose min amount for the terraforming parameter restriction.

Durability
: Defines the lifetime of the vegetation when the requirements aren't met. (hours)

Death color
: The color of the vegetation when it withers.

Max Slope
: The maximum slope the vegetation grows on. (0 - 90 degrees)

Hide If Slope Is More Than This
: Hide vegetation if slope is above this number. (0 - 90 degrees)

Procreate strength
: Used to resolve procreation conflicts between vegetations. Zero strength means no procreation at all.

Spread chance
: The chance to spread in a neighbouring tile. Accumulative for more than one neighbour.
